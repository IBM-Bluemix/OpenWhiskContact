# Process forms with OpenWhisk
The OpenWhiskContact is a simple Angular.js app processing a form data, this demo will demonstrates how forms can be processed without the need of having a backend using the [IBM OpenWhisk](http://openwhisk.org/) Serverless architecture. 
The UI is done using Angular.js with some out of the box features where can simply added to any project. 
There is no backend, all we have is a simple OpenWhisk Action that process the form. 
The OpenWhisk Action is then exposed as a Rest api to allow the Angular app to make a post request to.

For most Angular or React applications where most of the work been done on the client side but still you would need backend to preform some tasks such as processing a form, by using OpenWhisk you can go fully Serverless without the need of Backend management, simple create your Action and expose it as an API and use it in your frontend application.  
A good example of this, would be the [IBM-Bluemix GitHub.io](https://ibm-bluemix.github.io/) site where form processing is needed while the site is hosted on GitHub pages which means no access to backend.
The [IBM-Bluemix GitHub.io](https://ibm-bluemix.github.io/) site is a well-maintained, centralized, curated collection of open sample applications built using Bluemix and Bluemix services.
The source code for this example is taken from the [IBM-Bluemix GitHub.io](https://ibm-bluemix.github.io/) site.

Built using the IBM Bluemix, the application uses:
- IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk to host the API 
- Angulrs.js for frontend  
- SendGrid mail client 
**No runtime to deploy, no server to manage**

## Application Requirements
- IBM Bluemix account. [Sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=%2Fdashboard%2Fapps) for Bluemix, or use an existing account.
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) email client, sign up for free and get your token  
- GitHub Pages to host the frontend

## Running the app on top of GitHub Pages and OpenWhisk

  1. Clone or fork the repository 

  2. Checkout the code

  3. Ensure your [OpenWhisk command line interface](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli) is property configured with:

  ```
  wsk list
  ```

  This shows the packages, actions, triggers and rules currently deployed in your OpenWhisk namespace.
  
  
  4. Create an Email API using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) or any other mail client, using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) you can get free API to send up to 40k emails.
  5. Edit the OpenWhiskAction/action.js file, add your SendGrid API key and your email address to which you want to receive the emails. Save the file, next we will create the OpenWhisk Action.
      ```
      let SG_KEY = 'ADD SendGrid API Here'; //SendGrid API Key
      let to_email = new helper.Email('your-email@gmail.com'); //Add your email here
      ```
  6. Navigate into OpenWhiskAction folder
      ```
        $ cd OpenWhiskAction
      ```
  7. Create an action called mailAction from the action.js source file
      ```
        $ wsk action create mailAction action.js
      ```      
  8. Expose the action created "mailAction" as an API and keep note of the API endpoint you get in the terminal 
      ```
        $ wsk api-experimental create /api/v1 /mailAction post mailAction --annotation web-export true
      ``` 
  9. Add your OpenWhisk API from step 8 to the requestController.js file located in /app/controllers/requestController.js
      ```
         var API_URL = 'Your OpenWhisk API';
      ``` 
      Here is an example of a OpenWhisk API: `https://b4651037-d05a-4b7d-ab46-1e9a1abc096f-gws.api-gw.mybluemix.net/mailAction/api`
    
  10. Done, with that in place, you should be ready to go to host the code on GitHub.
  11. Commit the code to GitHub
  12. Create a new branch called gh-pages, GitHub will enable GitHub Pages when "gh-pages" branch is created with all the code.

   **Done, see the running application on GitHub:**
